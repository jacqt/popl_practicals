3.3 Strange loops!

loop0 : This loops on executing the function f. Since f() = exit, it returns and terminates

loop1 : This loops over an expression that defines a function with exit as its body. The 
        function is called, and this exits the loop.

loop2 : This loops over an expression that also loops again over executing f, where f() = exit.
        The program exits the closest loop that at runtime rather than at the moment when the
        function is defined 


3.4 Creating a continuations version of the interpreter

loop0 : No longer works, because there is no loop when the `exit` tag is defined!

loop1 : Works as expected

loop2 : Terminates as expected, since the exit is bound textually (i.e., it exits the outter
        loop construct rather than the inner one)
